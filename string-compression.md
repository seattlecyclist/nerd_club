# String Compression
Write a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeating characters.

For example: the string ```aaabbbccdddd``` becomes ```a2b3c2d4```

If the compressed string does not become smaller than 
the original return the original. ie: ```ab``` returns ```ab```

Input tring contains upper and lowercase.
